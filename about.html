                <h3>ABOUT OUR COMPANY</h3>
                <p>The textile industry in India traditionally, after agriculture, is the only industry that has
                    generated huge employment for both skilled and unskilled labour. The textile industry continues to
                    be the second-largest employment generating sector in India. It offers direct employment to over 35
                    million in the country.[1] According to the Ministry of Textiles, the share of textiles in total
                    exports during April–July 2010 was 11.04%. During 2009–2010, the Indian textile industry was pegged
                    at US$55 billion, 64% of which services domestic demand.[1] In 2010, there were 2,500 textile
                    weaving factories and 4,135 textile finishing factories in all of India.[2] According to AT
                    Kearney’s ‘Retail Apparel Index’, India was ranked as the fourth most promising market for apparel
                    retailers in 2009.
                    [3]India is first in global jute production and shares 63% of the global textile and garment market.
                    India is second in global textile manufacturing and also second in silk and cotton production. 100%
                    FDI is allowed via automatic route in textile sector. Rieter, Trutzschler, Saurer, Soktas, Zambiati,
                    Bilsar, Monti, CMT, E-land, Nisshinbo, Marks & Spencer, Zara, Promod, Benetton, and Levi’s are some
                    of the foreign textile companies invested or working in India.[4] Between January and July 2021 ,
                    India exported textile products worth Rs 1.77 lakh crore, which is 52.6 per cent more than the same
                    period last year.[5]</p>
